# Estimating the impact of climate change on crop yields in Malawi: a semiparametric neural network approach
BSE Spatial Data Module Term Paper

In the context of increasing food insecurity and climate risks, accurate crop yield forecasts are critical to
mitigate the effects of climate change. This study conducts an analysis of maize yield in Malawi under three
different future climate scenarios. Implementing a semi-parametric neural network and comparing the
results to other more commonly used machine learning techniques, our results demonstrate the complexity
of predicting crop yields, where models tend to overfit to the historical data. SNNâ€™s provide a promising
alternative, but must be carefully tuned and utilise bootstrap aggregation as well as other methods in order
to produce accurate and reliable results
